# Mathematical Modelling of Circadian Rhythm and Dopaminergic System

This simulation is an extension to the previous mathematical model of the circadian rhythm and DA system by Kim & Witelski to explore the effect of methylphenidate (MPH) on the circadian rhythm. 

Run `simulation.m` to compute the solution for the simulation.
